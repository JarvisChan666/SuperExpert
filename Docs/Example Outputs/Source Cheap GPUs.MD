Based on the requirements and available options, here is the recommendation for a high-performance NVIDIA GPU for running state-of-the-art LLMs:

Recommended GPU: PNY NVIDIA RTX A6000 48GB GDDR6 Graphics Card
Price: £4,341.99
Source: https://www.cclonline.com/vcnrtxa6000-sb-pny-nvidia-rtx-a6000-48gb-professional-graphics-card-397526/

Justification:

Memory Requirement: The RTX A6000 meets the minimum 48GB memory requirement.
CUDA Compatibility: As a recent NVIDIA professional GPU, it is compatible with CUDA 12.4 and above.
Performance: While not as powerful as the A100 or H100, the RTX A6000 is still capable of running state-of-the-art LLMs with its 48GB of GDDR6 memory and 10,752 CUDA cores.
Cost: At £4,341.99, it falls within the £5,000 budget constraint.
Availability: It is available as a new product, ensuring reliability and warranty coverage.
Alternative Options:

Used NVIDIA Tesla A100 80GB PCIe: £8,000.00 (https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/326214476335)

Exceeds memory and performance requirements but is over budget.
Used condition may pose some risks.
PNY NVIDIA A100 PCIe 40GB: £12,734.00 (https://it-market.com/en/components/modules/nvidia/900-21001-0000-000/953298-686528)

Excellent performance but significantly over budget and slightly below the 48GB memory requirement.
Conclusion:
The PNY NVIDIA RTX A6000 48GB is the best option that balances performance, memory capacity, and cost within the given constraints. While it may not match the raw performance of the A100 or H100 series, it is a capable GPU for running state-of-the-art LLMs and fits within the budget. If budget flexibility is possible, considering the used NVIDIA Tesla A100 80GB could provide superior performance for LLM tasks, but it comes with the risks associated with used hardware and a higher price point.
